# hello-lang
Hello is a toy language for learning about interpreters.

## Requirements
* Python (version 3)

## Running
Clone the repository and invoke `hello.py` with your local Python interpreter:
```
git clone git@github.com:bvh/hello-lang.git
cd hello-lang
python3 hello.py
```
This will drop you into the REPL. At present, the only recogized keyword is
`bye`, which will exit the interpreter and return you to the command shell.
All other commands, valid or otherwise, will simply be echoed back. (What do
you expect from six lines of code?)
